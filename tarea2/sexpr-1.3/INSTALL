To try things out, just type:

% ./configure
% make

Try out the example in the examples directory, or torture test things with the
testers in the tests directory.

To build the doxygen latex/html/manpages, type this:

% make doc

Look in doxygen/ for the files.

If you are working off a version of the code directly from git, you will
likely need to run automake before the ./configure line above:

% autoreconf --install
% ./configure
% make

To enable debug symbols and turn off optimization, configure with the
--enable-debug option set.

% configure --enable-debug
% make
